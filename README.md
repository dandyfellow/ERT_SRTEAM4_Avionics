# Avionics for team 4 EPFL Space Race 2024-2025


## Components and libraries
Mostly based of UncleRus's libraries
### MPU6500
Uses the MPU6050 library. Slight change in adress from 6500 to 6050.

### BMP280
Nothing unusual

### QMC5883L 
Class is called HMC5883L because that's what's written on my sensor. The QCM is basically a chinese copy with the same functionalities, but different adresses for ports and such. 
Using the QMC5883L library from UncleRus.
